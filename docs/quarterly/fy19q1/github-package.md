## Roadmap

### Q1 FY19 (Feb 2018 - Apr 2018)

#### Staffing: 24 person-weeks

- @kuychaco - 9 person-weeks (12 weeks - 2 weeks of reactor duty - 1 week travel)
- @smashwilson - 9 person-weeks (12 weeks - 2 weeks of reactor duty - 1 week @atom/watcher)
- ??? - approx. 6 person-weeks

#### Goals

##### * Recent commit history

_Near-term goal:_ An informational view that displays the most recent 1-3 commits beneath the mini commit message editor. Design and discussion in: [#554](https://github.com/atom/github/issues/554), [#86](https://github.com/atom/github/issues/86).

_Longer-term goals:_ Introduce interactivity to the commits shown in the recent history list. Right-click on the top click to amend it, or on prior commits to reset. Overhaul the "amend button" functionality and implementation.

##### * Commit co-authoring

_Near-term goal:_ Allow users to specify co-authors when committing. Draw inspiration from [Desktop's implementation](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/pull/3879) for UI. Tracking issue: [#1309](https://github.com/atom/github/issues/1309).

_Longer-term goals:_ Expose an API so that packages like teletype can add portal participants to commits automatically. Tangentially related to [#1089](https://github.com/atom/github/issues/1089).

##### * Pull request workflow - Create Pull Request

_Near-term goal:_ Add buttons in the GitHub panel to allow users to push any unpushed changes and open new pull requests. The "Open new pull request" button will link to the github.com compare view in browser. Open pull request: [#1138](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1138).

_Longer-term goals:_ Offer a complete in-editor experience. Compose pull request titles and descriptions in the GitHub dock item. However, we wish to avoid needing replicating the full .com experience, so to specify labels, projects, or milestones, we will preserve the "navigate browser to compare view" functionality, and focus on text composition.

This will require building out UI in the GitHub panel and adding GraphQL API support to create pull requests.

UI/UX considerations include:

* Offer a pop-out editor to craft PR descriptions in a full pane, similar to the commit editor pop out.
* Allow the user to specify the merge target.
* Show a preview of the list of commits that would be introduced by PR.

##### * Build stability

_Near-term goal:_ Fix that damn Travis hang documented in [#1119](https://github.com/atom/github/issues/1119). Resume the diagnosis work in [#1289](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/1289) and find a way to bring our build success rate back under control.

##### * GPG and credential handler overhaul

_Near-term goals:_ Passphrase prompting from git credential helpers and GPG has been a significant pain point since public release; unsurprisingly, because those are the areas where we need to leverage binaries and configuration from the users' system if present.

* Implement a "remember me" checkbox backed by keytar. This is probably our top feature request. [#861](https://github.com/atom/github/issues/861)

_Longer-term goals:_ Finish the credential handler refactor begun in [#846](https://github.com/atom/github/pull/846) to handle GPG 1.x through 2.3 and include diagnostic logging and testing.

* Improve our handling of 2FA credentials. Ideally we could detect when a user has 2FA enabled and prompt for a one-time code. [#844](https://github.com/atom/github/issues/844)

### Looking ahead to future quarters

In no particular order:

- Git Virtual File System support.
- Improved branch management. [#556](https://github.com/atom/github/issues/556)
- Introduce an overview dock item that summarizes and navigates to other functionality. [#1018](https://github.com/atom/github/issues/1018)
- Code review. [#269](https://github.com/atom/github/issues/269), [#268](https://github.com/atom/github/issues/268)
- `git log` pane.
- Merge or close pull requests.
- Browse and check out pull requests.
